## Getting Started

### Logging In
- [ ] Open the app in your web browser
- [ ] When prompted, enter the password: **dad**
- [ ] Click Submit

You're now in "Dad Mode" where you can create your custody proposals.

## Creating Your Custody Proposal

### Assigning Days
- [ ] Look at the **Palette Tool** on the left side - you'll see three options:
  - **Mom Days** (green) - for days the kids stay with Mom
  - **Dad Days** (blue) - for your days with the kids
  - **Clear** (eraser) - to remove an assignment
- [ ] Click on the tool you want (e.g., "Dad Days")
- [ ] Click on any calendar day to assign it
- [ ] The day will turn blue (for Dad) or green (for Mom)

### Tips for Planning
- Weekend days are shaded darker on the calendar
- Check the **Holiday Sidebar** (left edge) to see school holidays
- Watch the **Statistics** section - it shows:
  - Total nights for each parent (with percentages)
  - School days breakdown
  - Weekend distribution
  - Holiday distribution

## Saving Your Work

### Save Your Proposal
- [ ] Once you've assigned days, click **"Save to Dad Track"**
- [ ] Your proposal is saved automatically with the current date/time
- [ ] You can make multiple versions - each save creates a new timestamped version

## Viewing Previous Proposals

### Load a Saved Proposal
- [ ] Find the **"Load Dad Proposal"** dropdown menu
- [ ] Select any of your previously saved proposals by date/time
- [ ] The calendar will update to show that version

### Load Mom's Proposal
- [ ] Use the **"Load Mom Proposal"** dropdown
- [ ] Select one of Mom's saved proposals to view her plan
- [ ] This lets you see what she's suggesting

## Comparing Proposals

### See Where You Disagree
- [ ] Load one of your proposals from the "Dad Proposal" dropdown
- [ ] Load one of Mom's proposals from the "Mom Proposal" dropdown
- [ ] Click **"Compare Selected Proposals"**
- [ ] Any days you both claim will show in **purple** (these are disputed days)
- [ ] Days you agree on stay green (Mom) or blue (Dad)
- [ ] Click **"Exit Comparison"** when done

## Backup & Sharing

### Export Your Proposal
- [ ] Click the **hamburger menu** (≡) in the top left corner
- [ ] Click **"Export JSON"**
- [ ] Save the file to your computer
- [ ] You can email this file to your lawyer, mediator, or keep as backup

### Import a Proposal
- [ ] Click the **hamburger menu** (≡)
- [ ] Click **"Import JSON"**
- [ ] Select a previously exported JSON file
- [ ] The calendar loads with that proposal

## Important Notes

✅ **Your proposals are saved automatically** to the server when you click "Save to Dad Track"

✅ **Each save creates a new version** - you can always go back to older proposals

✅ **Purple days in comparison mode** mean you and Mom have assigned the same day to different parents - these need discussion

✅ **The percentages matter** - courts often look at the 50/50 split or other custody arrangements

✅ **School days vs. Summer** - Notice June and July in the summer have different patterns than school months
